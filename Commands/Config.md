# git config

When first setting up git, you'll need to work with the git config commands in order to set up your identity.

For examples, your identity canbe set up with commands such as:

```
git  config --global user.name "Name Name"
git  config --global user.ename "email@addr.com"
```

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
